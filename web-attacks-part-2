Directory Traversal:

Absolute vs Relative Paths:
Absolute ->From root directory '/'
Relative ->../../

can perform traversal with Encoding Special Characters(URL encoding)

Local File Inclusion (LFI):
File inclusion vulnerabilities allow us to "include" a file in the application's running code. This means we can use file inclusion vulnerabilities to execute local 
or remote files, while directory traversal only allows us to read the contents of a file. Since we can include files in the application's running code 
with file inclusion vulnerabilities, we can also display the file contents of non-executable files. For example, if we leverage a directory traversal vulnerability 
in a PHP web application and specify the file admin.php, the source code of the PHP file will be displayed. On the other hand, when dealing with a file inclusion 
vulnerability, the admin.php file will be executed instead.

in terminal commands we can use & to execute next command
 cd ../&ls  ->traverse backs and show list of files
