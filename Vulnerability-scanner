Vulnerability scanner:
Types:
Authenticated
UnAuthenticated
Internal scan
External scan

The basic process of an automated vulnerability scanner can be described as:
Host discovery
Port scanning
Operating system, service, and version detection
Matching the results to a vulnerability database

A false positive occurs when a vulnerability is detected but the target is not vulnerable. 
False negative is another important term. It occurs when a vulnerability is missed by the vulnerability scanner.
